# Hi Folks 🙋‍♂️
# This is Caption Pikaboo Speaking....📢

- Welcome to another tiny little project of mine.<br/>
- This is not very special but different shapes filled in a box container with only html and css.<br/>
- But nowaday various technologies have arisen and it is not recommended to use only css to make different shapes. <br/>
- 'cause it has no guarantee to have consistency with modern browsers <br/>
- As complex stuff of modern browsers need modern solutions, so we need to use modern web technologies such as SVG or Canvas 🤦‍♂️ <br/>
- They are recommended by many developers <br/>

- But it didn't include here cuz I'm a rookie 😁
